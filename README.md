# simple_dr_meter
compute Dynamic Range of audio files as defined by dr.loudness-war.info

The work is based on https://github.com/simon-r/dr14_t.meter

The point of the project is to evaluate some improvements which are easier to write from scratch than refactor the original codebase. If/when these improvements get integrated to dr14_t.meter, this project won't be needed.
